# Infrastructure

This directory contains infrastructure-related code and configurations for the hub project.

## Purpose

The infrastructure directory is dedicated to housing all infrastructure-related code, including but not limited to:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations
- Deployment scripts and templates
- Environment setup scripts
- Container configurations
- Cloud infrastructure definitions
- Infrastructure automation scripts

## Structure

The directory structure will be organized based on different infrastructure components and environments:

```
infrastructure/
├── README.md
├── environments/     # Environment-specific configurations
├── templates/       # Reusable infrastructure templates
└── scripts/        # Infrastructure management scripts
```

## Guidelines

- Keep infrastructure code separate from application code
- Document any environment-specific requirements
- Include clear instructions for infrastructure deployment
- Maintain version control for infrastructure changes
